# bs-google-cloud-datastore
It is a simple @google-cloud/datastore binding in ReasonML.

# Coverage
This wrapper is written for https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-node/#/docs/datastore/1.1.0/datastore.

The goal is to have enough function bindings for my personal projects. If you
need more, feel free to open a PR.

Currently, most functions have bindings, but some optional parameters were
ignored. Also, transactions have no binding.
